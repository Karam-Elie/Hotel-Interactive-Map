Anassa Interactive Map

An interactive map prototype built for Anassa Hotel, Cyprus, showcasing clickable hotspots for rooms and key locations across the property.

When clicking on specific rooms or areas, a popup displays images and descriptions.
The project aims to provide an easy and accurate visual reference for the Sales and Reservations teams, helping them better understand the hotel layout and explain it to guests effectively, even when not physically on site.

Tech Stack

The project was built using React with Vite for fast development, along with plain JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS3 for structure and styling. Inline styling was used for a responsive layout, and custom components were created for the image carousel and popups.

Notes

This project is a work in progress and will be further developed to include more hotspots, improved responsiveness, and dynamic content management through backend integration.
